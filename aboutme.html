<h1>About me!!</h1>
<p>
    As a dedicated student with a passion for calligraphy, I find joy in the elegance of beautifully crafted letters and the meditative process it offers. My love for the art of writing complements my keen interest in cybersecurity, where I am fascinated by the challenge of protecting information in an increasingly digital world. Balancing my time between honing my calligraphy skills and delving into the complexities of cybersecurity, I strive to cultivate both my artistic creativity and technical expertise, preparing myself for a future where I can blend these unique interests.
